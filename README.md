This is a Machine Vision course taken in NTNU TTK4255, where  this git shows my solution to various tasks within the field. Key words are Feature detection, feature extraction, feature matching, RANSAC, Epipolar geometry, minimization of reprojection error with optimizers such as Levenberg Marquardt, pose estimation, localization, mapping, visual odometry and generally simple pieces that could be combined together to make a visualSLAM algorithm.
